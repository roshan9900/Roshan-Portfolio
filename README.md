# Project 1: Understanding the Variables that Shape Flight Booking Choices [Link](https://github.com/roshan9900/British_Airways_Virtual_Pro)

- Analyzed 50,000 data samples to uncover key factors influencing flight booking decisions.
- Employed data preprocessing and machine learning techniques to predict bookings and achieved a high 92% prediction accuracy using the Random Forest algorithm.
- By analysing variables that affect flight bookings we can focus more on those variables which are helping to get bookings.
- Such models can be used in many industries like e-commerce, digital marketing, Supply Chain and Logistics and many more.
- Made a Power BI dashboard to present insights. 

### Features That Affect Flight Bookings

# Project 2: BERT-Powered Disaster Tweet Classifier [Link](https://github.com/roshan9900/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Disaster_tweets)
  - Utilized BERT for state-of-the-art text classification by fine-tuning the BERT Model to classify if the tweets are really related to disasters or not.
  - Achieved top 25% ranking on Kaggle with an Overall accuracy of 85% with a weighted f1 score of 0.85.
  - The dataset was too small to train such models, after a lot of combinations I was able to train the BERT with a very good accuracy.
  - Such applications can be used to monitor social media posts and news headlines to check if the posts and headlines are real or not.

# Project 4: Game Recommendation System [Link](https://github.com/roshan9900/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Steam_video_Reco)
- Used Flask, Pandas, scikit-learn libraries to make a web application that recommends games to users and was hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.
- The dataset has over 200k rows and columns containing information about users.
- Converted playing hours into ratings to quantify user preferences and enhance accuracy.
- Such applications can be used in E-commerce, Streaming Services (Movies, Music, Videos), Social Media, News and Content Aggregation, Search Engines such industries.
